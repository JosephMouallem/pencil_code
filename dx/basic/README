$PENCIL_HOME/dx/basic:
======================

This directory contins scripts for DX (data explorer) to do very basic
visualization of the fundamental variables.

To visualize e.g. the velocity field uu, start dx like this
  dx -edit $PENCIL_HOME/dx/basic/uu
once dx has started, type Ctl-o (execute once) to execute the program.
