$Id$

In this directory, the number in the file validated.dat gives the
revision number of the last successful auto-test that was run by a
user authorized to reset validated.dat.

For authorized users, the auto-test script writes the date of
each auto-test together with the previous revision number into
a machine-specific file, e.g. norosx52.albanova.se.auto-test.

The script pc_svnup accepts arguments -val or -validated, which
means that the current changes on a user's machine will be merged
into the last working version. This way every user can be sure that
any problems with the code must be due to the current changes done
by this user since the last check-in.

Examples:

  pc_svnup -src -s -val

brings all files in $PENCIL_HOME/src to the last validated status,
and merges all your changes into this version. This allows you to
work with this, but in order to check in your changes you have
to update everything to the most recent status first, i.e.

  pc_svnup -src

Your own changes will be merged into this latest version as before.

NOTE: The functionality of the head of the trunk should be preserved
at all times. However, accidents do happen. For the benefit of all
other developers, any errors should be corrected within 1-2 hours.
The pc_svnup -validate option allows all other people to stay away
from any trouble.
