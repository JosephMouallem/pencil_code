${PENCIL_HOME}/misc/f90-timings/
--------------------------------

This directory is for comparing timings for certain F90 constructs and
idioms on a multidtude of architectures and compilers, so we are sure we
the best variants in the code.

The timing tests here use some parts of the Pencil Code infrastructure
(like adapt-mkfile), but no code from Pencil.

If the tests involve arrays, we are rypically only interested in 1-d
arrays, as the Pencil Code operates on one pencil at a time. In order to
test for various array length, we use the file `param.inc'.

Usage:

  make code
  make timings
