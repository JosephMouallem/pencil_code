${PENCIL_HOME}/utils/wolf/tests
-------------------------------

The files under this directory are used for testing Perl modules and the
like.
It is unlikely that they are of much use to anybody else but myself, but
I'd like them to be committed with the code, and I don't think we
currently have a better place for such tests.
