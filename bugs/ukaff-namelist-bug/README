1. Symptoms:

  On Ukaff, the attached minimal code should print the following:
  
    1.
    2.
    3.
    Finished successfully
  
  but in reality crashes with
  
    1.
    2.
  
    lib-4001 : UNRECOVERABLE library error 
    
    Encountered during a namelist READ from unit 1
    Fortran unit 1 is connected to a sequential formatted text file: "run.in"
    IOT Trap
    Abort
  
  Commenting out almost any unused routine in magnetic.f90 or hydro.f90 or
  even just commenting out variables in these routines makes the code
  succeed.

  Using the compiler option -n32 instead of -64 also makes it work (at least on tac)

2. Command sequence:

  ukaff>  make
  ukaff>  run.x

3. Other compilers tested (OPK means problem could not be reproduced):
   - Intel F95  (Linux)  OK
   - NAG F95    (Linux)  OK
   - Compaq F95 (Tru64)  OK
   - Sun F95    (SunOS)  OK

6. Workaround:
   Move the namelist declaration

      namelist /magnetic_run_pars/ eta
 
   from magnetic.f90 to param_io.f90
