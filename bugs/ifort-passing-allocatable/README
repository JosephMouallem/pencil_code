                         passing_allocatable
                        ---------------------

1. Symptoms:

  When passing a chunk of an allocatable 4D array to a 
  subroutine, the subroutine will get the array starting 
  from the beginning, instead of just the desired chunk.

  Strangely enough, it only appears for 4D arrays.

2. Diagnostic:

   Intel compiler bug. Fixed in version 12.0.4.191.

5. Solution:

   Switch to a compiler that works.

6. Original date:
