#  Example:
#     move-slice data2
#
#  Usage:
#     Go into data dir where current slices are underneath proc dirs.
#     move-slice <new target directory where proc tree will be created>
#
#  Description:
#  Moves all slice files from the underlying proc directories to
#  the new target directory $1. It will be created if it doesn't exist yet.
#  If it does exit, but the proc subdirectories not, they will be created.
#  This routine is normally used when slice files has become too long.
#  This routine can also be useful when restarting, and old data are
#  corrupted or run will be restarted from another time.

#  16-nov-02/axel: made more robust; created directories that don't exist

# make target directory if it doesn't exist yet

# save current working directory

# loop through all proc directories
set procdirs  =  `ls | grep proc `

  #check whether proc directory already exists in new directory
  cd $1
  if (! -e $proc) then
    mkdir $proc
  endif
  cd $CWD

  # mv slice files to new directory
  echo "mv $proc/slice* $1/$proc"
  mv $proc/slice* $1/$proc
