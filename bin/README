Much of the documentation in this file is no longer up-to-date.
Most of th new commands start with pc_, so as to limit the name space
in a unique way.

In some case we keep the old and the new command. In the case of
pc_auto-test (and auto-test) we keep both commands, because the
former works with pc_auto-test, pc_build and pc_run, which not
used by everybody. The nightly auto-tests work with auto-test, so
as not to break the auto-test as further development with these
commands proceeds.

In October 2002 the files in this directory were

   4 CVS/                4 cvsci_run*      8 mkdotin*      4 run.csh*       4 x*
   4 README              4 getconf.csh     4 mkinpars*     4 setup-src*
   4 adapt-mkfile*       8 gpgrowth*       4 new*          4 start.csh*
   8 auto-test*          4 local*         12 nl2idl*       4 timestr*
   4 cvs-add-rundir*     4 mkcparam*       4 own-risk*     4 tst.csh*

setup-src (formerly lnsrc):
       is to be called from the corresponding run directory to link
       the source code into the src subdirectory. It also links
       the getconf.csh, run.csh, and start.in files into the run
       directory. When done, go into src and say "make".

timestr: produces a time stamp; used by several scripts.

tst.csh: runs start.csh and run.csh, and puts the results
         directly into a TEST.* file, where the asterisk
         denotes a time stamp.

adapt-mkfile: used by Makefile

new: produces a new run directory similar to another one.
     Usage "new rings1 rings1b" for example, produces a new
     run directory rings1b. You still need to compile the code
     in the corresponding run directory.

cvsci_run: used to check in a standard set of file that are frequently
     used for post-processing purposes (including time_series.dat and index.pro)

In the mean time there are many more files now. New files tend to
be preceded by "pc_" to identify them as Pencil Code scripts.

In April 2015 the files in this directory are more:
