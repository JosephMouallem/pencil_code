# Intel: optimization options
#
# You may use these options from your own configuration file like this:
#
# %include compilers/Intel_MPI
# %include compilers/extensions/Intel_optimal
#
# Please note that hardware optimizations require to compile the code
# on the same type of processor as the code is being executed later.
# If that is not the case, you will have to extend your host-config
# file to append additional '-x=... -ax=...' options indicating the
# target processor type and architecture.
