Compiler-based configuration scheme:
====================================
In the "compilers" folder you will find preset configuration files for
compilers suites in capital letters with the name "manufacturer-suitename".
These inherit separate configuration files stored in "compilers/separate/".

Host-based configuration scheme:
================================
Here, individual hostname-based configuration files can be stored, where you
can set host-related library and include paths, as well as optimization flags.
Usually, a host-file should inherit one of the compiler-suite configurations.

If for some reason, you have to mix FORTRAN and C compilers from different
suites, you can have a host-based configuration file inheriting directly the
settings from the two matching files in "compilers/separate/". But, you will
have to make sure that the number of underscores in function names are fitting
together between these two compilers. For that, you can just try out the
CFLAGS-option "-DFUNDERSC=x" for the C-compiler, where x is one of {0,1,2}.
Otherwise, nothing else should be neccessary. More information about the tested
combinations of compilers-settings, please refer to Table 1 in the manual.

Operating-System-based configuration scheme:
============================================
If you have no clue at all, you might just try the "os/GNU_Linux" configuration
for Linux-based systems, after installing the "GCC - GNU compiler collection":
$ cd work_directory
$ pc_setupsrc
$ pc_build -f os/GNU_Linux

If you need MPI, you can simply add it with:
$ pc_build -f os/GNU_Linux,mpi/default
