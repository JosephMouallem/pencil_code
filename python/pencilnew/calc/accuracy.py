    Assessment of accuracy of simulation:
    Computes the two-norm error of all available simulation, where the simulation
    with the maximum amount of grid points is used as the correct/reference solution.
    E.g., for runs with grid points assessment of accuracy of x-component of velocity
    along the y-direction, for runs with grid points nxgrid = n, 2n, 4n, 8n, compute

    || u_n - u_0 || = dy \sum\limits_{n=0}^n (sqrt(u_n(x_n)-u_0(x_8n)))
    
    for all runs (except for the 8n case, used as reference).

    Requires that the runs have matching grids, that is, grid refined by a factor of 2m,
    and grids adjusted so that the grid point overlap (needs ofset if periodic BC is used).
