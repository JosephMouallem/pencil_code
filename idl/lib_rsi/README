Here we keep important routines that should normally already be in your
/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib.

On some machines however, the versions may not be sufficiently
up-to-date. In some cases this has caused problems, so for conienience
we supply the neccessary version here.

on mhd0, mean.pro, for example didn't cope with the /double keyword.
