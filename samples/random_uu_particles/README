Comments:
    Tests drag force coupling between gas and particles, including heating, and
    particle collisions.

    For momentum conservation, try:
    IDL> .r momentum

    For energy conservation, try:
    IDL> .r energy

    For analysis of the distribution of particles, try:
    IDL> .r distribution

    The slight non-conservation is probably due to numerical viscosity, since
    the drag force scheme is constructed to conserve momentum.
