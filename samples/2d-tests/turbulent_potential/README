Recommended resolution:
    As high as 2D can be. 
Comments:
    Run using the turbulent potential prescription used in Horn et al. (2012), and before by Baruteau & Lin (2010), based on
        Laughlin (2007?). 
Reference:
    Lyra, W., Turner, N., & McNally, C.P. (2015), A&A, 574, A10. Rossby wave instability does not require sharp resistivity gradients.
