Comments:
  Added new test-case: premixed methane/air flame with simplified
  diffusion coefficients and non unity Lewis numbers. The flame is
  initialized via the file CH4_p01_0phi0_7000tu0300 obtained using a
  laminar flame code. A turbulent velocity profile is imposed at the
  inlet (from turbulent_box/data). The reduced chemical mechanism for
  methane and the Lewis number file are provided.
