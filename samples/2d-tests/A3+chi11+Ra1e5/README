Comments:
    Trying to reproduce: Table 2, column 1, of BNPST90
    Aspect ratio 3, density contrast 11.
    Stratification: cs0=0.2887, rho0=1
    Resolution: 150 x 51 (in the x and z directions).
    Ra=1e5, Fbot=0.001375, nu=K=0.0011
    typical timestep: 8.7e-3.
    The run has been done originally in the directory:
    pencil-code/runs/slab_conv/Hurlburt84-Ra1e5.
    The run never became steady: the downdrafts keep sweeping back and
    forth. It is unclear whether this is correct.
