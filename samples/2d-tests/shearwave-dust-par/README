Status:
    succeeds # One of [succeeds|failing since <date>|obsolete| ...]
Recommended resolution:
    None, but varying the resolution is a good test of how many grid
    points the code needs to resolve a shear wave.
Comments:
    Particle-gas shear wave test without gravity but with mutual drag
    force; used to test drag force assignment over the shear-periodic
    boundary.
