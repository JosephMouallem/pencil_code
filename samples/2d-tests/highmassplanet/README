    This is a copy of run H from Richert et al. (2015). It models a 10 Jupiter mass
    planet in a gas-only disk. The model uses a simple Newton cooling scheme with a
    quite short cooling time (a tenth of an orbit), so it looks close to the
    locally isothermal case. To change to the locally iosthermal case, change
    'entropy' to 'noentropy' in cparam.local, set 'llocal_iso=T' in start.in under
    'init_pars', remove the entropy boundary condition in 'init_pars' ('bcx'), and
    change 'gamma' from 1 to 1.4 in start.in under 'eos_init_pars'.

    For the pointmasses code, this tests the potential 'plummer' for the planet.
