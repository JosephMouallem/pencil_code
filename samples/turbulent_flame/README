Comments:
    Before running the main simulation three other simulations have
    to be performed in order to:
       1) Set up the initial 1D flame front
       2) Create the turbulence in the isotropic box
       3) Fill the domain with decaying turbulence from the isotropic box

    What should be done is therefore:
       1) Run the 1D initial condition setup (./init_cond_1D) in order
          to set up a good initial profile for the flame front. This is
          a one-processor run without MPI and it takes typically 5 minutes.
          The results can be visualized in IDL with the scripts
          "temperature.pro" or "species.pro" in the main folder by executing:
          IDL> .r ../temperature
          IDL> .r ../species
       2) Run the isotropic box (./turbulent_box) to be used as
          inlet condition. This is done in typically half an hour.
          Since this is a 8 processor job (as all the following runs)
          it should normally be submitted to the queue of your cluster.
          See that it has reached a statistically steady state by running
          IDL> pc_show_ts
          in IDL and check for 'urms' and 'umax'.
       3) Run the 3D initial condition setup (./init_cond_3D) in order
          to fill the domain with turbulence before the flame is introduced.
          For visualizing e.g. the velocity in the y and x direction in a
          2D slice in the xy plane open IDL and run the script "uu":
          IDL> .r ../show_uu
       4) Start the main simulation in the main directory: "./start.csh".
       5) Copy the generated 3D initial condition to the main simulation:
          $ pc_copyvar var.dat var.dat ./init_cond_3D . -e
       6) Run the main simulation. Please remember that if you want to
          continue running the simulation over multiple runs, you need to
          turn off the reinitialization of the chemistry in run.in.
          Species like 'H' or 'H2O' can now be visualized in IDL with:
          IDL> specie = 'H'
          IDL> .r species
          IDL> specie = 'H20'
          IDL> .r species


       If you are intersted in a flame in an isotropic box, instead of
       a flame in flow of decaying turbulence you can jump from 1) to 7).
       Unfortunately this has not been very well tested but I think it should
       work relatively fine.
       7) Run the 3D initial conditions found in init_cond_3D_isotropic.
          See that it has reach statistically steady state by running
          IDL> pc_show_ts
          in IDL and check for 'urms' and 'umax'.
       8) Run the startscript of the main simulation (found in 3D_isotropic).
       9) When the startscript finalizes your should use pc_copyvar
          $ pc_copyvar var.dat var.dat ../init_cond_3D_isotropic . -e
          in order to copy the 3D initial condition to the main simulation.
      10) Run the main simulation. Please remember that if you want to
          continue running the simulation even after it has finalized
          once you must turn off the reinitialization of the chemistry
          in run.in.
