Comments:
    This sample tests whether the Pencil Code compiles for an
    ultrahigh-resolution problem running on several hundred thousand cores. The
    problem can obviously not be run on a normal machine, but the code should
    compile. A failure to compile may mean that the Pencil Code uses arrays of
    global dimensions (i.e. involving nxgrid, nygrid, nzgrid, or a combination
    thereof).
