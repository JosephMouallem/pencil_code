Comments:
    Convection in a spherical wedge spanning 150 degrees in latitude
    and 90 degrees in longitude. Stratification is piecewise
    polytropic with a cooling layer on top, similarly as in the
    conv-slab sample. The stratification is read in from an ASCII
    file which is produced by the supplied IDL-script.
