Recommended resolution:
    32x32x32 for nu=eta=5e-3 is fine. For comparison with higher
    resolution runs see Brandenburg (2001, ApJ 550, 824), except that
    there a forcing wavenumber of kf=5 was used. The forcing function
    works with preselected wavevectors that were computed with:

Comments:
    This is a helical MHD turbulence run. After about 600 time units
    a large scale magnetic field develops from an initially random
    magnetic field (if initaa=0 is set).
