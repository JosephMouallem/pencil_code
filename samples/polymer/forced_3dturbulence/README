Comments:
   This is a three dimensional forced (non-helical) turbulence with polymers.
A polymeric viscosity is at present being used. This part of the code
is still being developed but it is added to the samples to inhibit
it from breaking down by future check ins. The algoritm used
is described in the following paper.

isotropic fluid turbulence with polymer additives."
