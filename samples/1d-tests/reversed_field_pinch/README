    succeeds # One of [succeeds|failing since <date>|obsolete| ...]
Recommended resolution:
    32x1x1 for eta=1e-2 is fine.
Comments:
    The initial field is a Bessel function. The field decays resistively
    subject to magnetic helicity evolution, as modeled by the dynamical
    alpha equation. A diffusive magnetic helicity flux is added.
References:
    The formalism is close to that used in:
