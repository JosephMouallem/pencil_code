Status:
    has been working in this form since 26-Feb-2006
Recommended resolution:
    400 meshpoints in -4 < x < 6, with nu=0.002 and chi=5e-4
    (Note that nu is here 10 times smaller than in sod_10,
    where no shock viscosity is used.)
Comments:
    Note that, although the shock front is equally well resolved
    as in the case with constant viscosity (i.e. no shock viscosity),
    the corners of the expansion shock are now much sharper.
    Verify that the total energy is constant by saying (in idl)
    plot,tt,eth+ekin,yr=[0,7] & oplot,tt,eth & oplot,tt,ekin
