    The run inevitably blows up at specific time (in this case t ~ 25). 
    The cause seems to be the shear, which is now fixed at q=1.5 
    (Keplerian rotation profile). If we raise this value, it explodes earlier.
Recommended resolution:
    nz=128 (nu=eta=1e-3) 
Comments:
    Magneto-rotational instability with Hall effect. Nonlinear saturation.
    
    The acoustic and MRI parts work together such that the acoustic waves seem 
    to lead to the saturation of the MRI. The acoustic wave is initially 
    dominant, but at some point the MRI (uperp_rms) takes over and at a later 
    time both seem to saturate. This situation is clearly shown plotting the
    logarithms of rms values (u_rms,uz_rms,uperp_rms) vs. time.
