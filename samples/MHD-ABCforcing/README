Recommended resolution:
    32x32x32 for nu=eta=1e-1 is used here and is fine. Somewhat smaller
    values would probably also work.
Comments:
    MHD with continuous ABC-flow driving. Unlike helical-MHDturb, which
    uses delta-correlated forcing that is added only at the end of each
    timestep, here the forcing is added on the rhs of the momentum eqn.
