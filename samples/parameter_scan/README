Here is a more general set of scripts that produce a series of jobs in batch.
These directories start with "scan_...".

To produce a new scan directory from an existing one (say scan_ABC), just say
  pc_cvsci_scan scan_ABC

You must then:
  1. cd ..
  2. cvs add scan_ABC
  3. edit "template/*"
  4. bin/do_all.csh

This checks in all the stuff at the same time. So you must be online.
The scipt also checks that you have checked it in and that you have
an executable.
