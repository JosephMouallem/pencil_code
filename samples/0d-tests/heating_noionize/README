Comments:
    As in the heating_ionize sample, here too we solve an ODE (hence 0-D):
        rho T ds/dt = heat_uniform
    However, unlike the heating_ionize sample, where we use eos_ionization,
    here we use eos_fixed_ionization with xHe=.1, yH0=0.
    Our units are again [rho]=1e-6 g/cm^3, [u]=km/s, [x]=Mm, [T]=K.
