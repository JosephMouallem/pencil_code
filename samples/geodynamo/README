Comments:
    Setup used for convective geodynamo simulations
    In the present setup, enhanced stratification has been used.
    Only the upper hemisphere is simulated (symmetry b.c. are used on the equator)
    ?AB: However, z starts from -1.1 instead of 0, so this setup doesn't make sense!
    ?AB:   xyz0  = -1.1,-1.1,-1.1,       ! first corner of box
