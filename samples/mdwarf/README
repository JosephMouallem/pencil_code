History:
    Since revision r8029 of 29-aug-2007, lbidiagonal_derij=T is the
    default; see the manual on page 127 (formerly page 100), see Fig.20
    (former Fig.15). In order to maintain agreement with earlier reference data,
    we used in this sample lbidiagonal_derij=F until 8-aug-10.
Notes:
    To simplify the input of in this sample, the specification of
    the input parameters cdt=0.4, cdtv=0.3, will be dropped in the
    future. The default is cdtv=0.25, so the result would change.
