Comments:
    Introduced polar spherical pole boundary conditions. 
    Including 3 tests: horizontal dipole and vertical dipole
    pure magnetic to check diffusion independent of boundary,
    and horizontal dipole with hydro to check consistency of 
    the yz-corner boundary necessary for stress tensor
