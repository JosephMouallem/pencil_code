History:
This code was written by Nils E. L. Haugen in 2002 and was
used mainly for homogeneous turbulence runs. Over the years,
the code has been kept functional by Axel Brandenburg, but
many of the developments in the rest of the Pencil-Code
are not implemented here.

Setting up the remeshing code:
Go into your pencil-code directory and say:
   cvs co -d remesh pencil-remesh

Make sure it is in your path. Under tcsh you set
 set path=($PENCIL_HOME/remesh/bin $path)

1) prepare new run directory, for example using "pc_newrun run_old run_new"
   compile with new resolution
   goto data and say, for example, "pc_mkproctree 128"
     if the new run has 128 processors.

2) go into old run directory, say setup-remesh
   got remesh, check/edit entries in common.local and compile
   go back, edit remesh.in, write name of new run directory (e.g. ../nolog512b)
   NOTE: If you are not running a run with shear set lshear=.false. in 
   remesh.f90
   NOTE: on a Mac, say 'mv Makefile Makefile.src" and then:
      $PENCIL_HOME/src/scripts/adapt-mkfile Makefile.src makefile

2b) The default is to remesh from var.dat, but if you want to remesh from
    another file, e.g. VAR7, then you edit a new file called varfile.in
    whose content says VAR7, without quotes.

3) either run remesh.csh interactively;
     (it asks for confirmation about new run directory name)
   or submit remesh.csh (won't ask you then)


NILS: There are plenty of things to be done with the remeshing utility:
1) There should be an auto test for remeshing.
2) Currently the remeshing does not work for remeshing on multiple
   processsors in the x-direction.
3) Should get rid of the goto statements
4) More commenting is required - it is rather hard to read the code
   as it is right now.
5) When you do make clean in the remeshing directory you must run setup-remesh
   in order to obtain Makefile.inc. This should not be necessary.
6) The remeshing should be set up to use the config machinery of Wolfgang, and
   by this avoiding the computer specific stuff in the Makefile.
7) This stuff should be adapted to 2-D slices of the form (x,y) or (x,z) [i.e. when we set
   lwrite_2d=True in start.in]
