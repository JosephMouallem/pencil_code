$Id$

This directory contains modules that are normally still functional,
and therefore also auto-tested, but they are now largely superseded
by other modules with a similar name. They are not really experimental
either, because they are not currently being developed. Once any
of these modules are being routinely used for production runs, we'll
move them back to the src directory.

This directory helps removing some of the ballast of the src directory
and it prevents those modules from being accidently identified by
newcomers as important modules that have been used for any recent
production runs.
